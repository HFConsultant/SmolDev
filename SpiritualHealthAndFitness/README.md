# Spiritual Health and Fitness

This is a modern web application built using the Next.js framework. It allows users to create an account or sign in with Google. There is a 'Posts' page where users can create and edit their own posts, as well as 'like' and comment on other user's posts. At the top of the page is the 'quote of the day', which is visible to anyone, but the user posts are displayed under it and only visible once a user is signed in. A button saying 'signin' is visible and allows signin for anyone not signed in.
